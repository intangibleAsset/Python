To create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

To activate virtual environment cd into env and run the
command source bin/activate or run source env/bin/activate
alternatively run env/bin/activate

idle wont work correctly as it can't be opened via the virtual env where imports are installed
